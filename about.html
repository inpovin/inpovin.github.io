                    I'm Anna - a junior at Vanderbilt University studying
                    Economics and Computer Science. Some of my academic interests
                    include human/computer interaction, behavioral economics, and ethics. I'm also passionate about art/design,
                    politics, education, and the social/cultural impact of technology.
                    I love examining the liminal spaces where all of these subjects intersect - for example, how can we use technology or enact policies to create a
                    more just and beautiful world for all?
                    <br><br>
                    At Vanderbilt, I'm a resident of the Mctyeire International Hall, where I dine and
                    discuss international politics/foreign affairs with graduate students, faculty, and my fellow peers. I'm also
                    heavily involved with VandyHacks, a student org dedicated to creating a culture of innovation at Vanderbilt through coding workshops and events.
                    I'm proud to be a part of an org that introduces computer science to students who may not have a background or previous experience in the subject, because I believe that technology should be for all.
                    In my free time, I like to run, read voraciously (everything from news to books to manga), and draw.
                    <br><br>
                    I hope to continue growing academically and professionally with a
                    focus on product management in the design or tech-for-good space.
